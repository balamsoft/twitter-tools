# create-twitter-blocklist.js

As it name implies, it creates a blocking list compatible with Twitter based on the list if accounts shown on screen.

How to use it:

- go to twitter.com
- go to someone's account you don't like (a bot, a hate speaker, etc)
- click his/her followers tab
- open the browser's console (Chrome for Windows: F12, Chrome for Mac: Cmd+Alt+I)
- paste the script in your browser's console and hit enter
- wait until the process is done (or click the gray "Copy" button next to "Show more" at any time to get a partial list).
- save all that text to a simple text file (change the file extension to CSV)
- go to Twitter.com > Configuration & Privacy > Advanced Options > Import List
- select the file you saved before

Note: If Twitter says the file is too large you can create another CSV file and paste there a small amount of accounts, then load the file, then repeat with another subset.

That's it!


# slingshot.js

Slingshot blocks all Twitter accounts shown on the screen, one by one. 
It won't block accounts you're actually following.

How to use it:

- go to twitter.com
- go to someone's account you don't like (a bot, a hate speaker, etc)
- click his/her followers tab
- open the browser's console (Chrome for Windows: F12, Chrome for Mac: Cmd+Alt+I)
- paste the script in your browser's console and hit enter
- keep the tab open until all accounts are blocked

You can use other browser tabs while it's working.
If you want to stop it just refresh the page or close the tab.
