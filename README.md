Resortera (slingshot) blocks all Twitter accounts shown on the screen, one by one. 
It won't block accounts you're actually following.

How to use it:

- go to twitter.com
- go to someone's account you don't like (a bot, a hate speaker, etc)
- click his/her followers tab
- open the browser's console (Chrome for Windows: F12, Chrome for Mac: Cmd+Alt+I)
- paste the script in your browser's console and hit enter
- keep the tab open until all accounts are blocked

You can use other browser tabs while it's working.
If you want to stop it just refresh the page or close the tab.
